A year later, I attended [Busconf](http://www.bus-conf.org/index.html) again (check previous codurance post). And just as a year ago, it was a fantastic experience.

As this time temperatures where a bit better (I think the high was 26C), the lack of AC on the [SeminarZentrum](https://www.natuerlich-tagen.de/) didn't create any issue.

On a Thursday, after dinner, we have lightning talks. There were a few interesting ones, but Frank took the cake with his. It is a pleasure to hear him talk. IT are spoiled brats.

Bartosz Milecki was there so on Friday there was basically a full track of Category Theory. I hhave his book, though is still on the queue.


I heard about [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) for the first time here last year. In case you odn't know, is a package manager that has a functional approach (check the link for more info). This time I attended a session by Tobi. I am actually looking forward to play with it more. The main reason? My scripts to setup a Fedora and Linux Mint system are annoying me too much. Will Nix improve this?, will it solve my issues?, time will tell.


There were a few sessions about Property Testing. It is a rather cool concept, and most mainstream languages nowadays have a library for it. I attended a session by Johannes on Property driven development. Basically, it was a practical demonstration on Java of the prime factors exercise/problem.

Marco Emerich introduced us to ReasonML. As a person that likes F#

Of the sessions that I missed, the ones that I regret the most missing were the Lenses sessions by Sara. From what I have heard people say, there were great. I was exposed to the idea of lense for the first time with [Freya](https://freya.io/), and is a concept that I want to investigate further.
