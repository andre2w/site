I was thinking a lot on this idea and even before joining Codurance I made a much long essay attempting to embrace the topic, but I never dared to publish it.

I come definitely from an agile background, I was a coach myself (well, I am, the coach is still there although maybe rusty due to lack of use) but back in time, XP was for me a fancy world and craftsmanship was simply something exclusive for handcrafts worker, blacksmiths and even for some homework.

Later on I found myself attracted by the idea that developing software would also be a craft, and developers can become craftspersons.

I started to get involved, got deeper into the Software Craftsmanship idea, dived into XP practices and inevitably matched them all with my Software Engineer and Agile Coaching background, and after ruminate on it for a while, I arrived to the the following statement:

**Agile** helps engage the business and the development team around a product, and tries to improve the interaction among them.

**eXtreme Programming** esablished principles and practices that help teams develop not only a product but also a culture of ownership on what the team is building.

**Software Craftsmanship** is more on a personal level, is the passion and the devotion you put into cultivating your skills, sharing knowledge, acquiring broader understanding and the way you embrace the endeavours you are given in a professional life.

All of them share the same vision: give visibility, shorten the feedback loop, enrich the interaction between stakeholders, as corolary, build a better product.

Each vertex of the trinity compliments the other, and on the contrary with the infamous [Iron Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle), growing one of them will help expand the others.

I know the statement might be missing details, but I still strongly believe in the categorization. In any case, I would love to read your thoughts on the matter, I am open to discuss and receive your feedback.


**PS:** I must confess I was thinking on calling this post _The Holy Trinity for proper software development_ but that could be too much and would have diverted the discussion towards the controversy: weÂ´ve said many times, nor Agile nor Craftsmanship are a religion.
